# Hi there, I'm Jan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Statistics MSc student at ETH Zurich with a passion for machine learning theory and applications in healthcare and climate science. My interests center around  interpretability, probabilistic machine learning, and generative models, with a particular focus on diffusion models and their theoretical foundations.


## Some recent projects I've been working on:

- **Neural Network Subspace Dynamics in Continual Learning**  
  Investigated whether catastrophic forgetting occurs primarily in the bulk subspace of the Hessian matrix, designing optimization algorithms to isolate learning in different subspaces.

- **Climate Downscaling Extrapolation with Elucidating Diffusion Models**  
  Researched transferability of statistical downscaling methods to unseen Global Climate Models, implementing elucidating diffusion models for high-resolution climate prediction. *(No public repository)*

- **Machine Learning for Healthcare**  
  Built interpretable models for medical diagnosis, including CNN-based pneumonia detection with interpretability techniques (Integrated Gradients, Grad-CAM) and heart arrhythmia classification using various deep learning architectures.

- **Probabilistic AI**  
  Applied Bayesian deep learning for satellite imagery, Gaussian processes for geospatial modeling, safe optimization for drug candidates, and entropy-based reinforcement learning.. *(No public repository)*

I'm always open to collaborating on interesting research problems at the intersection of machine learning theory and real-world applications. Feel free to reach out!
